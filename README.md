# Hangman
## Introduction
Basic game of Hangman. 

AIM: I created this game as a way for me to get used to using Java.

The program chooses a random word from the given set. The player can then guess letters in the word. Each incorrect answer adds a body part to the "hangman". The game ends when a player guesses all of the letters in the word or the entire man is drawn.

## Future
The text graphics are not perfect, and I could improve it by, for example, adding the hangman post. However, I do not plan to keep working on this because this was enough for me to get the hang of Java.
